This page provides an overview of the public The Lounge API.

**The Lounge API is not yet finalized and may change at any time.** Use at your own risk.
The plan is to have a stable public API that can be used by plugins, but it is simply not ready yet.

## Server APIs

{% include api.md type="server" %}

## Client APIs

{% include api.md type="client" %}
